Welcome to the GIT for the new VATAWARE.

The community forum may be accessed through http://forums.vatsim.net/viewforum.php?f=131 <-- that link.

The code meeting will determine our coding language and framework.

Thank you for your interest in the community development of Vataware v2.

We would like to request that at this time there are no direct pushes to master without coordination in the forums.
